# Clean Slate - Real Data Only

✅ **Both production and local databases are now completely clean!**

## What Was Cleared

### Production Database (Supabase)
- ✅ 1 customer
- ✅ 3 identifiers
- ✅ 1 click
- ✅ 1 lead
- ✅ All campaigns, influencers, links (0 found)

### Local Database (PostgreSQL)
- ✅ 1 customer
- ✅ 3 identifiers
- ✅ 1 click
- ✅ 1 lead
- ✅ All campaigns, influencers, links (0 found)

## Current Status

**Both databases are completely empty and ready for real data only.**

## Automatic Sync Service

✅ **Running in background** - syncs production → local every 5 minutes

The sync service will automatically pull any real data that comes into production:
- Customers
- Clicks
- Leads
- Events
- Campaigns
- Influencers
- Links

## How Real Data Will Come In

### Production
Real data will populate production through:
1. **Redtrack API Sync** - Every 1 minute (Vercel cron job)
2. **Zapier Postbacks** - Real-time conversions
3. **Direct API Calls** - `/api/ingest/click` and `/api/ingest/lead`

### Local
Local will automatically sync from production every 5 minutes via the background sync service.

## Verify Clean State

Check that both databases are clean:

```bash
# Check local
npm run db:studio

# Check production
# Visit https://todoalrojo-crm.vercel.app/dashboard/customers
```

## Manual Sync

If you want to force a sync right now:

```bash
# One-time sync
npm run sync:once

# Start automatic sync service (every 5 minutes)
npm run sync
```

## Stop Sync Service

To stop the background sync service:

```bash
ps aux | grep sync-production-to-local | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill
```

## Next Steps

1. **Wait for real clicks** from Redtrack
2. **Wait for real conversions** from Zapier
3. **Watch the dashboards** populate with real data
4. **Local will auto-sync** every 5 minutes

## No More Mock Data

From now on:
- ❌ No test data
- ❌ No fake data
- ❌ No demo data
- ❌ No sample data
- ✅ Only real production data

Your CRM is now production-ready and will only show real user data!
